[ ] unified-engine-language-server
[ ] support incremental changes
[ ] add documentation for more editors/IDEs
[ ] add automated testing, linting
[o] decide what to do with markdown, latex etc: whether this server should check them or if they should have their own servers. (Answer: I have decided to keep the implementation simple. Language-servers are responsible for spellchecking themselves.)
